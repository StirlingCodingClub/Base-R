# Stirling Coding Club
## Some tips & tricks using Base-R
### with a focus on data manipulation

A very short overview of what I'm hoping to talk about for this wednesday's Coding Club session.  
This will be very much an "introductory" session - in the sense that to make a point, I will be going through some of the basics of "data wrangling" in R. So be warned, it may be a little "too" basic for some of you!  

I'll cover the following -  
1. Matrices, dataframes & indexing (a very brief recap)  
2. Using match() to merge dataframes  
3. Doing "stuff" with rows and columns: using apply()  
4. Doing "stuff" with factors: using tapply()  
5. Lists and doing "stuff" with them: using lapply()  
6. I hope that the above will be really pretty quick so I am very happy to make up any remaining time with a bit of an "open" data wrangling session/discussion; I'll prepare a view toy data sets to play with.  

The presentation for the session can be viewed here.  
  
The practice "excercises" and links to toy data sets can be found here.
